    'What‚Äôs new in this update? WhatsApp is widely rolling out a video message feature, and it is available to more users starting today!In our article regarding the WhatsApp beta for iOS 23.12.0.71 update, we announced that WhatsApp was finally releasing the ability to record and share video messages. Specifically, this feature allows users to share real-time videos lasting up to 60 seconds, and it works as effortlessly as sending a voice note. Mark Zuckerberg has also announced that this feature will soon be released on WhatsApp and is expected to reach all users over the coming weeks. After installing the latest WhatsApp beta for iOS 23.15.1.76 update, which is available on the TestFlight app, we can confirm that this feature is now widely rolling out to a larger group of users!As you can see in this screenshot, you need to tap the microphone icon within a conversation to transform it into a camera button. Users also have the option to swipe up to enable a hands-free experience while recording the video. It‚Äôs worth noting that when video messages are opened in a chat, they will automatically play in mute mode, and sound will only be played with a tap on the video. Video messages you share in your chats and groups are always end-to-end encrypted, making sure they can only be played by the intended recipient.Using video messages also provide users with a benefit compared to regular videos. they mainly offer a faster and more straightforward way to show your emotions and share moments with others. In addition, video messages are always unique as they cannot be edited, modified, or normally forwarded. They always remain genuine and authentic. This also means that when someone sends you a video message, that video message was recorded exclusively for you.The video messages feature is now available to more users who have installed the latest WhatsApp beta for iOS updates from the TestFlight app, and it will be gradually rolling out to an even broader audience in the coming days. However, since this is a wider release, several users that installed the latest update of WhatsApp from the App Store may be able to get the same feature today.Stay up-to-date on WhatsApp news by following WABetaInfo on Twitter.
